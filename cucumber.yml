# Introducing obtuse naming convention for running all cucumber features with a formatter
# cucumber -p yz
#
#  y = Type of features  [ w = webrat , s = selenium ]
#  z = formatter [p = pretty, r = progress, f = profile]
#
# Note progress and profile are faster and more compact


wp:  features --format pretty  
wr:  features --format progress 
wf:  features --format profile
